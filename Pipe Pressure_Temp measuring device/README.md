# Pipe Temperature/Pressure measuring device
- <strong>Task</strong>: To do Component selection, Electrical circuit designing, PCB designing and Microcontroller programming.
- <strong>Type</strong>: Freelance project - Germany
- <strong>Discription</strong>:
<ul><ul>
<li> This project is about testing and comparing the capabilities of Infenion's KP256 digital barometric pressure and temerature sensor with TE connectivity's ms5837-02ba high precision pressure sensor using Arduino MCU.</li>
<li>I developed a custom 4 layer PCB containing 20 sensors at a interval of 1cm for the system which would be inserted in a test pipe for measurements. The interfacing program was written with C++.</li>
