# Pipe Temperature/Pressure measuring device
- This project is about testing and comparing the capabilities of Infenion's KP256 digital barometric pressure and temerature sensor with TE connectivity's ms5837-02ba high precision pressure sensor using Arduino MCU.
- I developed a custom 4 layer PCB containing 20 sensors at a interval of 1cm for the system which would be inserted in a test pipe for measurements. The interfacing program was written with C++.
