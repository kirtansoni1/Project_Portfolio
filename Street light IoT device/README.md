# Street light monitoring and controling IoT device
- This project is about monitoring and controlling over 100 street lights remotely, the device is connected to the internet via GSM. The device works on 2 MCU connected parallely for dual core processing. It can turn ON/OFF the lights and can also monitor the phase voltages and current for determining any issues like phase failure/oerload.
- I was responsible for developing PCB/Circuit and MCU programming of the device.
