# Automatic Preroll/Cigarette making machine

- <strong>Task</strong>: To do Component selection, Electrical circuit designing, PCB designing and Microcontroller programming.
- <strong>Type</strong>: Freelance project - USA
- <strong>Discription</strong>:
<ul><ul>
<li>Autonomously crush, mix and roll cigarettes.</li>
<li>Designed a comprehensive circuit and PCB utilizing the ATmega2560 MCU</li>
<li>Integrated a robust C++ firmware which efficiently manage the
concurrent operations of 20 stepper motors, 4 oscillators, and a vacuum
motor, resulting in exceptional productivity levels</li>
<li>component selection with proper calculations and prepared a
detailed documentation including wiring diagram</li>

- It is a machine which can crush, mix, fill and roll cigarettes fully autonomously, the user just needs to fill the mixture hopper and cigarette paper rolls.
- My task was to develop machine logic, Component selection/calculation, PCB Designing, Electrical designing, Microcontroller progamming.
- I Used AVR ATmega 2560 MCU, C++ language for programming and EasyEDA software for PCB designing.
