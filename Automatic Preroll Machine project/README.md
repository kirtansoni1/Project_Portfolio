# Automatic Preroll/Cigarette making machine
- It is a machine which can crush, mix, fill and roll cigarettes fully autonomously, user just needs to fill the mixture hopper and cigarette paper.
- My task was to develop machine logic, Component selection/calculation, PCB Designing, Electrical designing, Microcontrller progamming.
