# Automatic Preroll/Cigarette making machine
- It is a machine which can crush, mix, fill and roll cigarettes fully autonomously, the user just needs to fill the mixture hopper and cigarette paper rolls.
- My task was to develop machine logic, Component selection/calculation, PCB Designing, Electrical designing, Microcontroller progamming.
- I Used AVR ATmega 2560 MCU, C++ language for programming and EasyEDA software for PCB designing.
