# Project Portfolio - Kirtan Soni

Thank you for coming to my repository.

I am a master's student in AI for Smart Sensors/Actuators at Deggendorf Institute of Technology, Cham campus. With a strong interest in electronics and AI since my bachelor's, I have gained valuable experience of 4 years working on diverse projects and expanding my skills in this field. My continuous eagerness to learn new concepts equips me with the ability to efficiently solve complex problems and adapt to emerging technologies. My goal is to obtain a challenging role in Electronics/AI sector where I can utilize my skills for the betterment of the organisation and personal growth.

Please feel free to go through the projects of your interests!
