# Project Portfolio - Kirtan Soni

Thank you for coming to my repository.

I am a master's student in AI for Smart Sensors/Actuators at Deggendorf Institute of Technology, Cham campus. With a strong interest in electronics and AI since my bachelor's, I have gained valuable experience of 4 years working on diverse projects and expanding my skills in this field. This repo contains a collection of my projects which I completed throughout my career.

Please feel free to go through the projects of your interests!
