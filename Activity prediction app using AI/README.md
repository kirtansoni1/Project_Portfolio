# Human activity prediction app using AI

- <strong>Task</strong>: To make a mobile application which can access the Phone's Gyroscope and Accelerometer and predict the current activiy (Sitting, Walking, Running).
- <strong>Type</strong>: DIT â€“ Case study project
- <strong>Discription</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Collecting the Dataset</li>
<li>Data preprocessing and reshaping to train the AI model (RNN: GRU)</li>
<li>Using tensor flow to convert the model into .tflite format</li>
<li>Created GUI using Kivy/KivyMD</li>

  It also gives custom tasks based on your body profile and age like for e.g. 15 min running, once you activate the task it starts prediction and timer, it motivates you if you are walking or sitting instead of running and gives you appraisal if you complete the task. You can also track the amount of activity you did during the day or month. All data is well encrypted with RSA and stored using SQL.
