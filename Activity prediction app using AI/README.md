# Human activity prediction app using AI

- First semester case study project at my university
- This application accesses the phone's accelerometer and can give real-time prediction like Sitting, Walking, Running. It also gives custom tasks based on your body profile and age like for e.g. 15 min running, once you activate the task it starts prediction and timer, it motivates you if you are walking or sitting instead of running and gives you appraisal if you complete the task. You can also track the amount of activity you did during the day or month. All data is well encrypted with RSA and stored using SQL.
- Language - Python, KivyMD, AI model - GRU(RNN)
