- <strong>Task</strong>: To do Component selection, Electrical circuit designing, PCB designing and Microcontroller programming.
- <strong>Type</strong>: Freelance project - Germany
- <strong>Discription</strong>:
<ul><ul>
<li>Researched, designed, and developed a complete embedded IoT system for an Health Monitoring Device.</li>
<li>Developed ESP32-S3 based Embedded system from ground up (Hardware and Firmware)</li>
<li>Developed a customized compact sized and light PCB design (Rectangular, 50mm X 35mm), according to health standards.</li>
<li>Integrated sensors like Heart Rate and Blood Oxygen (MAX30102), Body Temperature (MLX90614), Environmental Temperature and Humidity (DHT22), and IMU Sensor (LSM6DS3)</li>
<li>Developed drivers for each sensor to work efficiently on board by carefully analysing the datasheets.</li>
<li>Developed a full power management system: Battery charging/handling circuit with protection standards, Voltage regulatory circuit (LM3671), etc.</li>
<li>Incorporated a RGB led to indicate the current status of the system to the user, like WiFi connected, Low Battery, High heart rate, etc. also integrated OLED display</li>
<li>Developed a complete Software integration with IoT pipeline and Web Dashboard.</li>
