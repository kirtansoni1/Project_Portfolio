# UGV for agriculture industry
- This is a robot which can autonomously detect and harvest date-palm fruits in the field. The robot initially starts from its charging station and then once the battery is full it searches for the ripe fruits, when it finds the fruit it goes close to the fruit and cuts it using high speed cutter infront of the robot. If the robot is stuck anywhere in the field it can send error code with its location to the master server. For the detection RPi is used and for the robot control AVR ATmega 2560 MCU is used which gets the command from the RPi using UART protocol.
- My task in this project was: Component selection/calculation, Electrical system designing, PCB designing, MCU Programming.
