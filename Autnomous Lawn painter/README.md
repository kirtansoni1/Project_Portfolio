# Autonomous Lawn Painter robot
- This project was my bachelors thesis, it is a robot which can spray desired letters on a landscape automatically with the input from an android application. The robot is controlled with Arduino Mega 2560 MCU programmed with C++. At first the robot is connected with the app using Bluetooh and user needs to give all the information, the robot will then go that pin pointed location and starts painting letters. After finishing it will return back to its origin.
